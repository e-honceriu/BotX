# Introduction

### Welcome to BotX!

This is a highly customizable Discord bot built with Python and Docker, designed for high-quality music streaming and gaming features. It includes built-in playlist functionality and integrates seamlessly with platforms like YouTube and Spotify. Additionally, it supports League of Legends integration, providing a variety of tools for users to connect and manage game lobbies, track leaderboards, having a built-in elo system for competing with your friends. 

This bot is an implementation integrated with the [BotCore](https://github.com/e-honceriu/BotCore) backend, which is also a project developed by me. BotCore serves as the core infrastructure fot the bot, enabling seamless communication and funtionality between the bot and its various features.

# Installation Guide

Follow the steps below to setup and run the project using Docker.

## Prerequisites

- **Docker**: [Download Docker](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop)
- **Docker Compose**: Docker Compose is usually included with Docker Desktop, but if not, you can install it from [here](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/).

## 1. Clone the Repository

- Start by cloning the repository to your local machine:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/e-honceriu/BotX
    cd BotX
    ```

## 2. Configure Environment Variables

- Modify or create the `.env` file located in the root directory of the project.

- The `.env` file should include the following variables:

    ```bash
    BACKEND_URL=
    DATA_PATH=
    BOT_API_KEY=
    DISCORD_TOKEN=
    ```

- **`BACKEND_URL`**: 
    - The URL of the backend server that the bot communicates with (i.e., the URL where the [BotCore](https://github.com/e-honceriu/BotCore) runs).
- **`DATA_PATH`**: 
    - This is where your bot stores files it needs to operate, such as logs, configuration files, ad mp3 files. 
    - You should specify the **absolute path** where you want these files to be saved.
    - **Example**: `/home/user/bot/data`
- **`BOT_API_KEY`**:
    - The API key required to interact with the backend server, see [BotCore](https://github.com/e-honceriu/BotCore) in order to generate one.
- **`DISCORD_TOKEN`**:
    - This token is used to authenticate your bot with the Discord API. 
    - You can get your token by creating a bot in the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications). 
    - After creating your bot, navigate to the "Bot" section of the application settings and copy the token.

## 3. Build and Run the Bot

- In the root directory of the project, run the following commands to load the environment variables, build the Docker image (if not already built) and start the bot. 
- Note that this might take a while if it is the first time you are running it.

    ```bash
    source .env
    docker compose up --build
    ```

## 4. Access the Bot in Discord

- Once the bot is running:
    - Invite the Bot to Your Server:
        - If the bot is not already in your server, you need to invite it.
        - Go to the OAuth2 tab in your bot's application page in the Discord Developer Portal.
        - Under OAuth2 URL Generator, select the required permissions and generate an invite link.
        - Use the generated link to invite the bot to your server.
    - Use bot's commands
        - Use the [List of Commands](#commands) provided in the documentation.

## 5. Stop the Bot

- You can stop all containers, including the bot, by running in root directory of the project:

    ```bash
    docker compose down
    ```

## 6. Updating the Bot

To update the bot with the latest changes from the repository:

- 1. Pull the latest changes from the repository

    ```bash
    git pull origin main
    ```

- 2. Rebuild the Docker images to apply the updates:
